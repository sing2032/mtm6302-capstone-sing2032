Project: Astronomy Picture of the Day Search

**Design Decisions:**
I have decided to adopt a dark theme for this project, as it aligns perfectly with the astronomy motif. I've carefully selected fonts, colors, and elements to ensure they harmonize with one another. To enhance the impact of the content, I've chosen a background image of a black hole.

**Report:**
The website creation went fairly smoothly, with few challenges encountered. I followed the mockup wireframe I had created, which provided a basic structure and concept for the site. However, I did initially overlook the need for a button to select the date. To address this, I changed the "View favourites" button on the index page to "View picture," allowing the user to select the desired date. Additionally, I added navigation buttons to enable seamless transitions between pages, enhancing the user experience.
